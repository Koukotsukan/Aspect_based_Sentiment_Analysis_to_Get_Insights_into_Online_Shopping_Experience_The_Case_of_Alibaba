# 2. Installation
## Linux Users:
**1.** `cd` into a nice place to put your project. (DO NOT PUT IT IN ROOT DIRECTORY)

**2.** Put the following command to download & install the project
```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Koukotsukan/Aspect_based_Sentiment_Analysis_to_Get_Insights_into_Online_Shopping_Experience_The_Case_of_Alibaba/main/scripts/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh
```
<small>*if you failed to `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the install.sh, you may need to do it manually.*<small>

**3.** `cd Aspect_based_Sentiment_Analysis_to_Get_Insights_into_Online_Shopping_Experience_The_Case_of_Alibaba-main` folder, run `python3 app.py`.

**4.** Now your server is running on 80 port.

**NOTICE**: If you skipped inputting your Google reCAPTCHA V3 sitekey and secret, you can use command `cd .. & ./install.sh -r` to refill the keys. But if you want to change the keys, you may need to do it manually. The site keys are in `static/js/index.js` and secrets are in `app.py`.

## Windows / Unix / Mac OS Users:
**1.** Download the source code either by using git clone or directly downloading.

**2.** Install [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (MUST USE 7zip), `cd` the main folder and then, `cd checkpoints/`, then you need to unzip all the zip files. After you get the 3 folders, delete the zip files.

**3.** Manually change the reCAPTCHA v3 keys in `static/js/index.js` and secrets in `app.py`

**4.** Open the main folder as a PyCharm project, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`, and then run the `app.py` to start your journey. The server runs on 80 port, you can change as you want in the `app.py`.

The repo only provided the best performance models for Fast-LCF-ATEPC, LCF-ATEPC and BERT-baseline-uncased. If you want all the trained models, due to the size of all the models are too large, I put them on TeraBox, you can download [here](https://terabox.com/s/1NxBufViyj6UzeCBeKQqSwg). After you finish downloading, put all the folders into `checkpoints/` folder.

### App Experience

The Alibaba app is a significant aspect of user experience, with both positive (170 mentions) and negative (91 mentions) sentiments expressed. Users appreciate the app's ease of use and comprehensive features. However, some users encountered issues with performance, interface, or functionality. This suggests that while the app provides a generally positive experience, there are areas for improvement to enhance user satisfaction.

### Alibaba Platform

Users generally have a positive view of Alibaba (167 positive mentions), indicating trust in the brand and satisfaction with the services and products offered. However, some users expressed negative sentiments (67 mentions), possibly relating to certain policies, services, or features. This indicates that while Alibaba as a platform is well-received, attention should be given to addressing the concerns raised by users.

While many users are satisfied with the pricing on Alibaba (87 positive mentions), some users found the prices of some products to be high (47 negative mentions). This suggests that while Alibaba's pricing strategy is generally appreciated, it could be beneficial to review the pricing of certain products to ensure competitiveness.

While they appreciate aspects like the app, Alibaba platform, and pricing, they also express concerns about app functionality, shipping services, and communication. By addressing these concerns, Alibaba can further enhance user satisfaction and strengthen its position as a leading e-commerce platform.
